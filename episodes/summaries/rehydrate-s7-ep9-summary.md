Jessica observes with trepidation as only she (and perhaps Alia) understand the true consequence of Paul embracing the role of Lisan al-Gaib, messiah of the Fremen. After Gurney’s misunderstanding about Jessica is resolved. Chani is summoned from the deep desert where she finds Paul catatonic, both “dead and alive”, having dared to drink a single drop of the poison known as “the water of life”. After a precarious revival, Paul awakens from his coma, forcefully drinks a full cup of the poison, and does not so much as share but bludgeons his new awareness on Jessica, showing more evidence that he is the Bene Gesserit dream of a Kwisatz Haderach.

A raid on Sietch Tabr has killed Paul and Chani’s son Leto and taken Alia captive. Alia is no helpless captive, and uses her position in front of the Baron to administer Chekov’s gom jabbar into his flesh, leaving him to die. Paul learns of this, not through direct report, but by sensing Alia in his awareness. 

Paul leads the attack on Arakeen. His strategy takes advantage of a loophole within the military accord of the Great Convention, proscribing the use of atomics being used against people. Paul deploys atomics on the shield wall, infuriating the Emperor. 

Once Paul and the Fremen are reinstated in Arakeen, Thufir Hawatt and Paul reunite briefly, and the man’s final act is to sacrifice himself on a poison needle meant for Paul. Paul’s forces do massive damage to Harkonnens and he himself faces the emperor. He threatens to destroy the spice forever. Feyd-Rautha challenges Paul in his closest battle yet, but Paul emerges victorious again and demands Princess Irulan as a bride and a path to the throne. Chani and Paul’s bond is strengthened as they settle into roles familiar to the reader as Duke and concubine.

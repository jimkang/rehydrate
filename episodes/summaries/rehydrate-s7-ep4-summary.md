Jessica is awoken by a drunken Duncan Idaho accusing her of being a Harkonnen spy, to which Jessica immediately suspects Hawat, but after speaking face-to-face, she is convinced that he is not the spy.

Jessica’s thoughts reveal that she is pregnant with the Duke’s daughter, and not even the Duke knows at this point.

On the way to speak to Jessica, Duke Leto finds Tuek has been killed and further down the hall he sees Shadout Mapes also near death, but before he can activate his shield, he feels a dart pierce his arm and looks to see Yueh, who had sabotaged the generators. Yueh tells the Duke that he actually wishes to kill the Baron Harkonen and will install a poison tooth that the Duke will have to bite down on to kill him when he breathes out the poison gas. In exchange, Yueh promises to get Paul and Jesscia to safety.

Jessica awakens tied up as Baron Harkonen and Piter stand over her. Piter was promised Jessica, but the Baron instead offers to give him a duchy of land on Arrakis, to which Piter agrees. The Baron leaves the decision what to do with Jessica to Piter as to not have any culpability.

Piter, also wanting to not take responsibility, orders that Jessica and Paul are to be taken to the desert for the worms.

En route to the desert, Paul uses the Voice to convince their captors to un-gag Jessica, who promptly convinces the guards to fight over her and the deaf guard, Kinnet is killed. Jessica compels Czigo to let Paul go so he can have Jessica to himself. While lured by her, he is immediately killed by Paul’s expert kick to the heart. 

Yueh is brought into the see the Baron to get his “reward.” The Baron reveals that he’s killed Yueh’s wife and will let Yueh join her as Piter stabs Yueh through the back.

 Baron Harkonen threatens Duke Leto with torture to find the location of Paul and Jessica. Leto remembers the tooth and bites down to expel the gas towards the Baron. However, the Baron manages to barely escape by activating his shield. Piter is not so lucky and is taken by the poison.

Paul and Jessica hide out in a stilltent that had been set up by Yueh, and Duncan Idaho brings them to a location in the desert that he thought was safe. Paul finds newfound cold clarity about his situation of his father’s death, Yueh’s betrayal, his responsibility as the new Duke, and that it is the Fremen that are paying the guild in spice to ignore what is happening in the deep desert.

Paul also tells Jessica that Leto never actually suspected her of being a traitor.
Paul briefly starts to feel that he can see into the past and future through the experiences of people. He is angry at Jessica for selfishly designing him specifically designed to be a male Bene Geserit and the Kwisatz Haderach.

Paul realizes it’s the spice that’s slowly both poisoning him and enhancing his senses, but he, like everyone else on Arrakis will die if they were to stop taking it, realizing that he is trapped.
Jessica tries to change the subject back to escaping the Harkonnens, Paul tells her plainly, that they themselves are Harkonnens, and what’s more, Jessica is the Baron’s daughter.

Paul realizes that his role is much greater than any struggle between houses, and as he contemplates the way forward, he prophesies that the Fremen people will call him Muad’Dib, ‘The One Who Points the Way’ and finally, gives himself the time for the death of his father.
